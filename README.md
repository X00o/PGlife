Pglife - Web Development Project

Pglife is a fully-functional web application designed to help users find and manage paying guest accommodations with ease. Developed using a robust tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, the project showcases my ability to create dynamic and responsive web pages with a seamless user experience.

Key Features:

Responsive Design:  Built with HTML and CSS to ensure a mobile-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes.

Interactive User Interface: Utilized JavaScript to create an interactive and engaging user experience, including form validations, dynamic content loading, and smooth navigation.

AJAX Integration: Implemented AJAX requests during the login process for real-time validation and improved user experience by avoiding full-page reloads.

Secure Authentication: Used PHP and incorporated a hash function to securely encrypt user passwords, enhancing the security of user data.

Backend Development: Leveraged PHP for server-side scripting to handle user authentication, session management, and data processing.

Database Management: Designed and managed a MySQL database to store user data, property listings, and booking details securely.

End-to-End Functionality: Ensured the applicationâ€™s full-stack integration, from the front-end design to the back-end database, creating a cohesive and reliable user journey.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack web development and my commitment to delivering secure, user-friendly, and comprehensive web applications from conception to deployment.
